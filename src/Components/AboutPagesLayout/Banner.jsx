                  <p>I've spent the last few years working as a freelance developer that specializes in Javascript(front-end) and node(back-end) as the sole developer for a local start-up along with various other compaines in Las Vegas. 
                    I acquired project and time management skills, as well as the ability to communicate with new team members and clients while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.</p>

                  <p>During my time working on a multitude of web Development projects I've had to learn other languages and app structures on the fly in order to effectively complete projects. Some of these skills include: React, Vue, Webpack, SQL, PHP, WordPress, jQuery, SASS, LESS, Bootstrap, along with other modern development necessities like the software development life cycle(agile, waterfall mainly). 
                    I put all the skills I've learned over the years to good use on every project I work on.</p>

                  <p>During these uncertain times I keep my own morale high by enjoying my free time with my dog Tika Masala and working with exciting new technologies like Three.js, WebGL, Blender among other fun animation tools.</p>
                  
                  <p>I am always available to discuss your project over the phone or via Skype. </p>
